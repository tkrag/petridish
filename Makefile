# petridish — one entry point for the whole gate.

# `make check` is the command to run before proposing any change. It is what CI
# runs, so a green `make check` locally means a green CI run.
#
# Note the form of the `check` target: its gates are PREREQUISITES, not commands
# joined by `;` in one recipe line. That is load-bearing. A recipe like
#     check:
#         cargo fmt --check; cargo test
# returns only the LAST command's exit status, so a formatting failure would
# report success. Verified empirically — keep them as prerequisites.

# Deliberately NOT a prerequisite of `check` or `check-all`: it takes minutes,

# Args: RUNS, CONC, FILTER — e.g. `make flake-hunt RUNS=48 FILTER=s8_pty`. All three are
# passed explicitly, defaults included, because the script's arguments are POSITIONAL: a
# bare `$(RUNS) $(CONC)` expands to nothing at all when unset, so `make flake-hunt CONC=4`
# would hand the script a single argument and it would read that 4 as RUNS. `$(or ...)`
# keeps each position filled whatever the caller sets. FILTER was documented here before it
# was ever forwarded; it is now.

# Uses whatever is already in node_modules rather than `npm ci`. CI does the
# clean install; locally, reinstalling from scratch on every check is slow and
# fails outright if the npm cache has permission problems, which is not a
# signal about this code. Run `npm ci` in integrations/raycast yourself if the
# lockfile changed.

cinnamon:       ## Check the Cinnamon applet's parser (needs node, nothing else).
	node --test integrations/cinnamon/tests/

# Same rationale as `cinnamon` above — omarchy/tkrag.petridish/parser.js is a
# duplicate of the Cinnamon applet's parser (a plugin directory has to be
# self-contained to be copied into ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/), tested the
# same way.
omarchy:        ## Check the Omarchy bar widget's parser (needs node, nothing else).

# Everything CI runs. Kept separate because `deny`, `msrv` and `raycast` each
# need a tool a contributor may not have installed — cargo-deny, a second
# toolchain, and node respectively — and a gate that fails on a missing tool
# trains people to ignore it. Run this before opening a PR; run `check` while
# iterating.

# `cargo test`'s systemd coverage all goes through the RecordingSystemctl seam
# (real for argv/ordering/error-mapping, but never the real `systemctl`
# binary or a real unit search path). These exercise the real thing, inside a
# Lima VM (LIMA_INSTANCE=default by default), against your own real project
# data — macOS has no systemd --user to test this against directly. See
# petridish-cli/scripts/lima-dev.sh for the one-time VM setup these assume.
# Deliberately not part of `check`/`check-all`: they need a Lima VM, which CI
# doesn't have (CI's own Linux systemd coverage is the
# linux-systemd-smoke job in .github/workflows/ci.yml instead).
